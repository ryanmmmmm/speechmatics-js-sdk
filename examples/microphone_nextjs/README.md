This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First you will need to add you API key to the next.config.js file. If you don't have an API key, you can get one from our [Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com).

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) with your browser to see the result.
